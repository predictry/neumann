#Neumann
Service Provider: Neo4j

##Configuration
See [doc](doc/Configuration.md) system for configuration

##Server

In production, the server should be run by uwsgi, via supervisor. In development mode, you can just run the
[server.py](src/neumann/server.py) from the interpreter, and it will initiate in debug mode.

Before starting up, the server.py script does a few things to setup the environment. 
First, it configures logging, based on the logging.json configuration file located at the base of the project. 
Second, the scripts sets up indexing in the configured Neo4j database, by running Cypher queries on the [index](resources/db/schema.index)
file, if it is present.


##Container

The Docker container run script, [run.sh](scripts/run.sh), exposes a folder with data files generated by Tasks.
These files are required by Luigi, our task execution framework. They can be output from some tasks, used as input
for others; checkpoints for executed tasks, or just data required by a third party.
The folder is mounted to a /data folder on the project's root. For tasks that use these files as output,
if a request to re-execute is sent, the task will be executed again if they're missing.
